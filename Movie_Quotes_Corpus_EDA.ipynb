      "and to distinguish between two script versions of the same movie, we automatically\n",
      " matched each script with an entry in movie database provided by IMDB (The Internet\n",
      " Movie Database; data interfaces available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces). Some\n",
      " amount of manual correction was also involved. When  more than one movie with the same\n",
      " title was found in IMBD, the match was made with the most popular title \n",
      "(the one that received most IMDB votes)  \n",
      "\n",
      "After discarding all movies that could not be matched or that had less than 5 IMDB \n",
      "votes, we were left with 617 unique titles with metadata including genre, release \n",
      "year, IMDB rating and no. of IMDB votes and cast distribution.  We then identified \n",
      "the pairs of characters that interact and separated their conversations automatically \n",
      "using simple data processing heuristics. After discarding all pairs that exchanged \n",
      "less than 5 conversational exchanges there were 10,292 left, exchanging 220,579 \n",
      "conversational exchanges (304,713 utterances).  After automatically matching the names \n",
      "of the 9,035 involved characters to the list of cast distribution, we used the \n",
      "gender of each interpreting actor to infer the fictional gender of a subset of \n",
      "3,321 movie characters (we raised the number of gendered 3,774 characters through\n",
      " manual annotation). Similarly, we collected the end credit position of a subset \n",
      "of 3,321 characters as a proxy for their status.\n",
